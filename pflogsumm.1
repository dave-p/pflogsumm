.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
.Vb 4
\&    Pflogsumm is a log analyzer/summarizer for the Postfix MTA.  It is
\&    designed to provide an over\-view of Postfix activity, with just enough
\&    detail to give the administrator a "heads up" for potential trouble
\&    spots.
\&    
\&    Pflogsumm generates summaries and, in some cases, detailed reports of
\&    mail server traffic volumes, rejected and bounced email, and server
\&    warnings, errors and panics.

\&
\&                   Emit detailed reports.  At present, this includes
\&                   only a per\-message report, sorted by sender domain,
\&                   then user\-in\-domain, then by queue i.d.
\&
\&                   WARNING: the data built to generate this report can
\&                   quickly consume very large amounts of memory if a
\&                   lot of log entries are processed!
\&
\&    \-h <cnt>       top <cnt> to display in host/domain reports.

\&
\&    \-\-help         Emit short usage message and bail out.
\&    
\&                   (By happy coincidence, "\-h" alone does much the same,
\&                   being as it requires a numeric argument :\-).  Yeah, I
\&                   know: lame.)
\&
\&    \-i
\&    \-\-ignore\-case  Handle complete email address in a case\-insensitive
\&                   manner.
\&                   
\&                   Normally pflogsumm lower\-cases only the host and
\&                   domain parts, leaving the user part alone.  This
\&                   option causes the entire email address to be lower\-
\&                   cased.
\&
\&    \-\-iso\-date\-time
\&
\&                   For summaries that contain date or time information,
\&                   use ISO 8601 standard formats (CCYY\-MM\-DD and HH:MM),
\&                   rather than "Mon DD CCYY" and "HHMM".
\&
\&    \-\-mailq        Run "mailq" command at end of report.
\&    
\&                   Merely a convenience feature.  (Assumes that "mailq"
\&                   is in $PATH.  See "$mailqCmd" variable to path thisi
\&                   if desired.)
\&
\&    \-\-no\-no\-msg\-size
\&
\&                    Do not emit report on "Messages with no size data".
\&
\&                    Message size is reported only by the queue manager.
\&                    The message may be delivered long\-enough after the
\&                    (last) qmgr log entry that the information is not in
\&                    the log(s) processed by a particular run of
\&                    pflogsumm.pl.  This throws off "Recipients by message
\&                    size" and the total for "bytes delivered." These are
\&                    normally reported by pflogsumm as "Messages with no
\&                    size data."
\&
\&    \-\-problems\-first
\&
\&                   Emit "problems" reports (bounces, defers, warnings,
\&                   etc.) before "normal" stats.
\&
\&    \-\-rej\-add\-from
\&                   For those reject reports that list IP addresses or

\&
\&                   By default, pflogsumm looks for entries in logfiles

\&                   If you\*(Aqve set a non\-default "syslog_name" parameter
\&                   in your Postfix configuration, use this option to

\&

\&
\&                   For the message deferral, bounce and reject summaries:
\&                   display the full "reason", rather than a truncated one.

\&
\&                    In other words: replace the numeric value with "ID".
\&
\&                   By specifying the optional "=2" (second form), the
\&                   munging is more "aggressive", converting the address

\&
\&                        "list\-return@host.sender.dom"
\&
\&                   Actually: specifying anything less than 2 does the
\&                   "simple" munging and anything greater than 1 results
\&                   in the more "aggressive" hack being applied.

\&    Pflogsumm makes no attempt to catch/parse non\-Postfix log
\&    entries.  Unless it has "postfix/" in the log entry, it will be
\&    ignored.
\&
\&    It\*(Aqs important that the logs are presented to pflogsumm in
\&    chronological order so that message sizes are available when
\&    needed.
\&
\&    For display purposes: integer values are munged into "kilo" and
\&    "mega" notation as they exceed certain values.  You can easily
\&    change all of this with some constants near the beginning of the
\&    program.
\&
\&    "Items\-per\-day" reports are not generated for single\-day
\&    reports.  For multiple\-day reports: "Items\-per\-hour" numbers are
\&    daily averages (reflected in the report headings).
\&
\&    Message rejects, reject warnings, holds and discards are all
\&    reported under the "rejects" column for the Per\-Hour and Per\-Day
\&    traffic summaries.
\&
\&    Verp munging may not always result in correct address and
\&    address\-count reduction.
\&
\&    Verp munging is always in a state of experimentation.  The use
\&    of this option may result in inaccurate statistics with regards
\&    to the "senders" count.
\&
\&    The "percent rejected" and "percent discarded" figures are only
\&    approximations.  They are calculated as follows (example is for
\&    "percent rejected"):
\&
\&        percent rejected =
\&        
\&            (rejected / (delivered + rejected + discarded)) * 100
\&
\&    There are some issues with the use of \-\-syslog\-name.  The problem is
\&    that, even with Postfix\*(Aq $syslog_name set, it will sometimes still
\&    log things with "postfix" as the syslog_name.  This is noted in
\&    /etc/postfix/sample\-misc.cf:
\&
\&        # Beware: a non\-default syslog_name setting takes effect only
\&        # after process initialization. Some initialization errors will be
\&        # logged with the default name, especially errors while parsing
\&        # the command line and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf
\&        # configuration file.
\&
\&    As a consequence, pflogsumm must always look for "postfix," in logs,
\&    as well as whatever is supplied for syslog_name.
\&
\&    Where this becomes an issue is where people are running two or more
\&    instances of Postfix, logging to the same file.  In such a case:
\&
\&        . Neither instance may use the default "postfix" syslog name
\&          and...
\&
\&        . Log entries that fall victim to what\*(Aqs described in
\&          sample\-misc.cf will be reported under "postfix", so that if
\&          you\*(Aqre running pflogsumm twice, once for each syslog_name, such
\&          log entries will show up in each report.
