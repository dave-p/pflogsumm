.Vb 4
\&    Pflogsumm is a log analyzer/summarizer for the Postfix MTA.  It is
\&    designed to provide an over\-view of Postfix activity, with just enough
\&    detail to give the administrator a "heads up" for potential trouble
\&    spots.
\&    
\&    Pflogsumm generates summaries and, in some cases, detailed reports of
\&    mail server traffic volumes, rejected and bounced email, and server
\&    warnings, errors and panics.

\&
\&                   For summaries that contain date or time information,

\&

\&
\&                   By specifying the optional "=2" (second form), the

\&    Pflogsumm makes no attempt to catch/parse non\-Postfix log
\&    entries.  Unless it has "postfix/" in the log entry, it will be
\&    ignored.
\&
\&    It\*(Aqs important that the logs are presented to pflogsumm in
\&    chronological order so that message sizes are available when
\&    needed.
\&
\&    For display purposes: integer values are munged into "kilo" and
\&    "mega" notation as they exceed certain values.  You can easily
\&    change all of this with some constants near the beginning of the
\&    program.
\&
\&    "Items\-per\-day" reports are not generated for single\-day
\&    reports.  For multiple\-day reports: "Items\-per\-hour" numbers are
\&    daily averages (reflected in the report headings).
\&
\&    Message rejects, reject warnings, holds and discards are all
\&    reported under the "rejects" column for the Per\-Hour and Per\-Day
\&    traffic summaries.
\&
\&    Verp munging may not always result in correct address and
\&    address\-count reduction.
\&
\&    Verp munging is always in a state of experimentation.  The use
\&    of this option may result in inaccurate statistics with regards
\&    to the "senders" count.
\&
\&    The "percent rejected" and "percent discarded" figures are only
\&    approximations.  They are calculated as follows (example is for
\&    "percent rejected"):
\&
\&        percent rejected =
\&        
\&            (rejected / (delivered + rejected + discarded)) * 100
\&
\&    There are some issues with the use of \-\-syslog\-name.  The problem is
\&    that, even with Postfix\*(Aq $syslog_name set, it will sometimes still
\&    log things with "postfix" as the syslog_name.  This is noted in
\&    /etc/postfix/sample\-misc.cf:
\&
\&        # Beware: a non\-default syslog_name setting takes effect only
\&        # after process initialization. Some initialization errors will be
\&        # logged with the default name, especially errors while parsing
\&        # the command line and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf
\&        # configuration file.
\&
\&    As a consequence, pflogsumm must always look for "postfix," in logs,
\&    as well as whatever is supplied for syslog_name.
\&
\&    Where this becomes an issue is where people are running two or more
\&    instances of Postfix, logging to the same file.  In such a case:
\&
\&        . Neither instance may use the default "postfix" syslog name

\&    For certain options (e.g.: \-\-smtpd\-stats), Pflogsumm requires the
\&    Date::Calc module, which can be obtained from CPAN at
\&    http://www.perl.com.
\&
\&    To add geolocation to the smtp connection reports, install the
\&    (deprecated) Maxmind Geo::IP module from
\&    https://github.com/maxmind/geoip\-api\-perl and legacy geoip databases
\&    from https://mailfud.org/geoip\-legacy/
\&
